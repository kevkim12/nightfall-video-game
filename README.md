## General information
The creation of Nightfall's scripts were used with the Rojo Roblox extension. While models and other important assets are not in this repository, all of the important and essentials scripts for the game are provided. More information about the game can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/kevkim/nightfall?authuser=0).

## Game description
Nightfall is a shooter game operated on a round-based system where players must eliminate entities designated as the Infected (zombies). Players must either survive or complete objectives by killing the zombies or satisfying missions. However, there are many different zombie classes which can drastically change gameplay. Players are rewarded for their efforts and can purchase new items to enhance their chances for survival or clothing to customize their avatars. The game was inspired by the Left 4 Dead series.

## Technologies
This project is created with:
* Lua (RBX.lua)
* Roblox Studio
* Blender
* Adobe Photoshop
* Paint.NET

## Infected variants
### Walker
Walkers are the most common zombie variants in the game. They look like regular players with shambly movement animations and various shades of blue or green as their skin color.

### Runner
Runners are uncommon zombie variants that function very similarly to the walker variants. Rather than walking at normally, they run.

### Bloater
Bloaters are uncommon zombie variants that are distinguishable with their overly large stomachs (due to storing toxic acid). They have an ability to release dangerous gas. They function very similarly to the walkers with the exception that they will explode in a small radius when killed. This can severely hurt players.
